<hr>
1. On the first step after run appliaction you should see default `login page` ,if you created account from firebase side great but if not just click on `sign up button`.
<hr>
2.After that you should see simple two buttons , and there you can decide to create you own nickname or generate random UUID and that will be you identificatior in messages
<hr>
3.After all of these above steps you should see simple dashboard with few `options`
<br/>
-Firstly you can open new incognito tab , generate new ID or nicname and just copy this id and add this user as a new `contact`
<br>
-Secondly you can see when you will send a message , automaticly this message is encrypted what you can see in `Result of encryption` next to the chat box
<br>
Also you have an option to check this via `Decrypt via AES` this checks you result from previous message and will upload the same translated method to verify the correct working of decrypt.
